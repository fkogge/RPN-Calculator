# RPN-Calculator
Java programming project from Seattle University's Computer Science Fundamentals program.
## About this Project
This program simulates a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator. The user must enter a valid RPN expression, such as "4 15 5 / +" which would evaluate to 7.0 ((15 / 5) + 4 = 7.0).
