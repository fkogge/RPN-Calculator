# RPN-Calculator
Java programming project from Seattle University's Computer Science Fundamentals program.
## About this Project
This program simulates a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator. A generic Stack data structure is utilized in order to organize the order of the operands and and operators found in the RPN expression. Note that the user must enter a valid RPN expression, such as "4 15 5 / +" which would evaluate to 7.0 ((15 / 5) + 4 = 7.0).
